      The penguin is an aquatic, flightless bird who exclusively resides in the Southern Hemisphere.
      It can adapt in both land and sea and feeds on small aquatic life-forms, such as fish, krill, 
      and squid. Penguins hunt either in groups or by itself, and during breeding season, penguins 
      nest in huge groups and establish nesting territory amongst each other.
