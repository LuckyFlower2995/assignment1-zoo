      The panda is a bear whose main diet consists of bamboo. Their native habitat lies largely within
      the bamboo forests in the mountains of Southwestern China. Their thick fur keeps them warm from 
      the cool forests in the mountains. They have powerful jaws and teeth to chew and gnaw the tough 
      bamboo.
