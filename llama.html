      The llama is a domestic animal with thick, wooly fur whose native range lies in the Andes Mountains of 
      South America. It is primarily used a pack animal, being able to carry as much as 200 pounds. Llamas are 
      very social animals that travel in herds consisting of a dominant male leader, female llamas, and their 
      kids.
