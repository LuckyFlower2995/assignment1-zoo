      The koala is a marsupial native to southeastern Australia, inhabiting the Eucalypt forests for 
      shelter and food. It spends its days high up in the trees to hide from predators, chewing leaves 
      and napping to digest their food. Unlike male koalas, female koalas have a pouch to carry their kid.
