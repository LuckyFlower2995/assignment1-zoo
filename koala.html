      The koala is a marsupial native to southeastern Australia, inhabiting the Eucalypt forests for 
      shelter and food. It spends its days high up in the trees to hide from predators, chewing leaves 
      and napping for a long period of time to digest their food. Like the panda, while it has poor 
      eyesight, it has a great sense of hearing to detect predators, as well as a great sense of smell 
      to detect its kin.
